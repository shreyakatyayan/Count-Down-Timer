# Count-Down-Timer
This is a basic Countdown Timer created using HTML to provide the structure for displaying time left until a specific event or deadline.

Features:

Clean and simple layout using HTML

Sections for displaying days, hours, minutes, and seconds

Semantic HTML elements for better readability and accessibility

Ideal as a base structure for integrating with CSS and JavaScript for full functionality

Note: This version includes only the HTML structure. To make the timer functional, JavaScript is needed to handle time calculations and updates.
